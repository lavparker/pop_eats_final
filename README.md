Background

The world is direverse in many different ways, but one thing that every country has in common is food. Food is a comfort that brings can community to the table, and with the mix of different spices, textures and flavors, country by country. People have decided as a group what their top dish is and many countries have identified it as their national dish. Pop_eats is an interactive visual experience where the user will be able to hover over each country, determine what the national dish is and learn a cool facts about the respective country. The goal for this project is to spread the love of food and curiosity of culture and diversity to others. And to maybe even find a fun new dish to try!

Functionality and MVPs

In Pop_Eats, users will be able to:

Use the cursor to use a the input to hover over an interactive map of the world Select a country and view the country’s top dish and facts about the country Use a search bar to find a country by name and view the country’s top dish and facts about a country Easily be able to find the recipe for the country’s top dish (drag and drop?)

This project will also include: 
A production README file A modal describing how the page should be used to allow the user’s optimal enjoyment of this experience.

Technologies, Libraries, APIs

This project will use a combination of D3 and Canvas. As the project grows, I’d like to explore additional libraries to determine If there additional libraries that will make the page more engaging. A stretch goal is to alter the color of each state in a way that allows the flag Colors to appear in each country’s hover box. I’d also like to use undetermined APIs for in order to determine country facts and country dishes My timeline is as follows:

Friday/ Weekend:

Draw out a visual map for my desired result including hover features and facts that I want to display. Gather information, from APIs and libraries that are of interest and determine realistic day by day expectations in order to complete and optimize this project. Begin researching countries and laying frameworks.

Monday/ Tuesday:

Build interface/ front end capabilities that engage event listeners, hovering, drag and drop and overall HTML/ CSS for user visualization. Begin back end.

Wednesday/Thursday,

Build out back end and include the country dishes, facts and if there is time flags once hovered over the country.
